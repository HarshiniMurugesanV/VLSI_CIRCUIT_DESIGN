A Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) is designed to provide a direct interface with the CPU at speeds not attainable by DRAMs and to replace DRAMs in systems that require very low power consumption. The design difficulty of the SRAM is that data will be lost if SRAM is not powered. SRAM does not offer to refresh programs. SRAM has a low storage capacity. The existing method is an ultra-low-voltage bit-interleaved synthesizable 13T SRAM circuit. Nowadays, less number of transistors are required to design the SRAM cells without affecting exact operations as same as the 13T SRAM. Hence, the proposed model involves 6T SRAM cells in CMOS technology with channel length of 55nm. The overall implementation is held in SPICE simulation.
